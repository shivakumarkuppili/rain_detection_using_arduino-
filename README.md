# RAIN_DETECTION_ARDUINO
A Rain Detection System was developed using Arduino and C++ to provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for smart rain monitoring. The system uses a resistance-based rain sensor module to detect rainfall. When water is present, the sensor's resistance drops, triggering the Arduino to read the change. If the sensor value falls below a set threshold, the Arduino activates a buzzer to alert nearby users of rainfall.

#HOW IT WORKS

Step 1: Understanding the Rain Sensor
Step 2: Circuit Connections
  Buzzer to Arduino and Rain Sensor to Arduino
Step 3: Uploading the Code
